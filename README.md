# Polynomial multiplication with CUDA

Implementation of trivial (schoolbook) and [Karatsuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm) method of polynomial multiplication. Both methods are implemented for Nvidia GPUs using [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) framework.

Karatsuba algorithm is based on [this article](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/224.pdf).
